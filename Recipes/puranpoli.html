    <p>Puran Poli is a flatbread stuffed with a sweet lentil stuffing. In Marathi language the sweet stuffing is called as Puran and the bread is called as Poli.</p>

    <p>The stuffing is made from chana dal which are husked and split black chickpeas also known as bengal gram. The sweet element in the stuffing is jaggery which is unrefined sugar that is made from sugar cane juice.</p>
    
    <p>This puran poli recipe has spices like ground cardamom, ground fennel seeds, ground nutmeg and ground dry ginger added to the stuffing.</p>

    <p>The poli or the flatbread is also made from whole wheat flour (atta) and all purpose flour (maida). For a yellow colored flatbread, add some ground turmeric powder in the dough.</p>

    <ul> <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <li>1 cup blanched chana dal</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon ghee</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds powder</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>salt as required</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon refined oil</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered jaggery</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon powdered green cardamom</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon nutmeg powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <ol> <strong>Method:</strong>
        <li><strong>Prepare the filling for Puran Poli</strong>
            <p>Put a saucepan over medium flame and add ghee to it. Once the ghee is melted, add blanched dal in it. Roast for 2-3 minutes and then add jaggery, ginger powder, cardamom powder, fennel powder and nutmeg powder into it. Mix all the ingredients and cook the dal for another 2-3 minutes. Once done, turn off the flame and let it cool. Then mash the dal using a masher.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Knead the dough</strong>
            <p>In a dough kneading plate, add all-purpose flour, turmeric, salt to taste and refined oil. Mix well and then add a little water at a time and knead to make a stiff dough. Divide the dough into 3 parts and keep it aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Make Puran Polis</strong>
            <p>Take one part and press it a little to make space in the centre. Once done, take the chana-jaggery mixture and fill it in the centre. Close and shape again like a ball. Grease your hands a little and make roti with your hands. You can roll it out using a rolling pin too.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Puran Polis</strong>
            <p>Put a tawa on medium flame and place the roti on it. Add 1/2 teaspoon ghee and cook well from both sides. Serve hot or pair with tea or coffee.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <ul> <strong><em>Chefs tips:</em></strong>
        <li>Soak chana dal for 30 minutes before you pressure cook it so that it is evenly cooked.
        </li>
        <li>If you don't want to use sugar, you can also use powdered or grated jaggery. It is a healthier choice than processed refined sugar.
        </li>
        <li>Mash the dal and jaggery mixture very well using a potato masher. No chana dal should be left unmashed in the stuffing as it will be difficult to roll out thin Puran Polis.
        </li>
        <li>Knead a soft dough. You can use half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour too.
        </li>
        <li>Apply ghee on the Puran Poli only when the golden brown spots appear while toasting. This will give the dish a crispy texture.
