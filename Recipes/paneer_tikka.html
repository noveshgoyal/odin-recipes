    <ul><strong><em> Chefs tips:</em></strong>
        <li>Paneer should be fresh and cut into medium sized cubes.
        </li>
        <li>Other vegetables that can be used are corn, broccoli, mushrooms, potatoes and cauliflower too.
        </li>
        <li>Gram flour is added so that the tikka does not stick to the PAN.
        </li>
        <li>A little oil can be brushed on top of the tikkas before they are cooked.
        </li>
        <li>If there is excess marinade, along with the oil as mentioned above you could brush the marinade too on top of each tikka.
        </li>
        <li>If using bamboo skewers for the first time, immerse the whole lot in lots of water for a minimum of 20 minutes to avoid getting them burnt.
        </li>
        <li>You could also grill the cubes of paneer first, then grill the vegetables and before serving put them on skewers alternately and attractively.
        </li>
        <li>In case you want to use use a combination of coloured capsicums – use 1/2 of each and cut into wedges.
        </li>
        <li>If you are not serving vegetables, toothpicks could be used to serve the grilled paneer as a party snack.
        </li>
        <li>Do not overcook, the tikka has to be moist and soft.
        </li>
